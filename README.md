#Challenge 2
Arrays were created for tickers, starting price, ending price and Totalvolume. The macro can be ran only once from top row to end row to get all the data. The loop was degined to stop when it reached a new ticker and the next ticker can be looped from the previous ending row. The running time is shorter than the original macro.
